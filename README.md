# Google Meet Plugin

> Note: This plugin doesn't work for @gmail.com accounts because they don't have permission to create meetings by the `https://g.co/meet/` url.

The **Google Meet Plugin** adds a button in the header bar in all channels:

When a user press the button, a message with the meeting link is automatically sent for the channel:

The meeting room link is based on the team and the channel names.
